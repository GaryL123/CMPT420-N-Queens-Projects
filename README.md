# CMPT420-N-Queens-Projects

Members: Gary LaPicola, Louie Celiberti, Thomas Scardino

Project 3: Generate a random 8-queens instance and solve it (where possible) using hill climbing search (steepest-ascent version).

⦁	Report of the results. Run the program for 20 times (generate 20 random instances) and print the solution(s) of the solved instance(s). If you don’t find any solution in the first 20 runs, keep running the program and generating new random instances, until an 8-queens solution is found. Print the solution.

⦁	Give a brief statistical analysis on the percentage of solved problems (number of total instances generated and number of successful solution(s) found).

Project 6: Write a recursive program in Java or C++ that implements backtracking to solve the 8 queen puzzle. Start with an empty board and display the solution (board arrangement) your program found.

⦁	Extra credit is given to solve the n queen problem. Your program should ask the use for n and show a solution.
